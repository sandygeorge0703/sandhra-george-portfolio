                mount utilising CATIA, emphasising precision and functionality
                in design.
              </li>
              <li>
                Optimised the component design through advanced Finite Element
                Analysis (FEA) techniques using 3DEXPERIENCE, enhancing
                performance and reliability.
              </li>
